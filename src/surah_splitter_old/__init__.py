# TODO later: Uncomment the imports below when the package API has stabilized
# and these modules are fully implemented and tested. This will expose
# the core functionality directly from the package root, enabling users
# to import these components with: from surah_splitter import function_name

# from surah_splitter.quran_toolkit.ayah_matcher import (
#     match_ayahs_to_transcription,
#     AyahTimestamp,
# )
# from surah_splitter.quran_toolkit.surah_processor import (
#     process_audio_file,
#     split_audio_by_ayahs,
#     process_surah,
# )

# # Import logger from utils for easier access
# from surah_splitter.utils.app_logger import logger, setup_logger, TimingContext
